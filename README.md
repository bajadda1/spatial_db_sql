# 🌍 Spatial Databases - Practical Work Overview

## 📝 **Introduction**
This practical work focuses on **Spatial SQL**, a specialized extension of SQL used for managing and querying spatial data. Leveraging tools like **PostGIS** (a spatial extension of PostgreSQL) and **QGIS**, this TP explores how spatial data can be stored, manipulated, and analyzed.

**Spatial SQL** enables users to perform operations such as:
- 🧭 Distance calculations
- 🗺️ Proximity analysis
- 🔗 Spatial joins

These are crucial in **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** and applications such as:
- 🏙️ Urban planning
- 🌋 Disaster management
- 🌳 Environmental monitoring

## 📌 **TD-1: Installation of PostGIS and Creation of a Spatial Database**
### 🛠️ **Steps:**
1. **Install PostgreSQL** and the **PostGIS extension**.
2. Create a spatial database using **pgAdmin**.
3. Verify the PostGIS setup.

---

## 📌 **TD-2: Creating Tables with Spatial Columns**
### 🛠️ **Steps:**
1. Create spatial tables with different geometry types:
   - 🟢 **Point**
   - 🟣 **Polygon**
   - 🔵 **Linestring**
2. Insert spatial data into these tables using **QGIS**.
3. Verify the inserted data using SQL queries.

## 📌 **TD-3: Advanced Spatial Queries with PostGIS**
### 🛠️ **Steps:**
1. Introduction to **spatial queries** and operations in PostGIS.
2. Execute queries to:
   - Analyze spatial relationships
   - Perform geometric operations
3. Explore:
   - 🔗 **Spatial joins**
   - 📍 Proximity-based queries
